# New Moon: Budapest

>DESIGNATION: 618-Budapest

>RISK LEVEL: MCXI

>POPULATION: None, as humanity was forced to abandon their once-flourishing home due to devastating space warfare.

>CONDITIONS: Budapest, once a thriving city nestled on the edge of the galaxy, now lies in ruins. Vines reclaim the concrete structures, and trees stand tall where buildings once stood, creating a hauntingly beautiful landscape.

>FAUNA: Nature has reclaimed Budapest, with wildlife flourishing amidst the ruins. Trees provide shelter for birds and small animals, while vines and moss blanket the decaying remnants of human civilization.

>HISTORY: Budapest was once a beacon of creativity and culture, a city where technology and nature coexisted harmoniously. However, the outbreak of space warfare brought an abrupt end to its peaceful existence, forcing humanity to flee and leaving the moon to be reclaimed by nature.

>POSSIBLE WEATHER: Rainy, Stormy and Foggy 

>ROUTING COST: 800
